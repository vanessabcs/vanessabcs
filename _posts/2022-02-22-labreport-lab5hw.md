## The Python Experience

When I lived near my parents, I remember how many times I only had time for a quick visit but ended up staying for hours, just because I had been caught by a scene of a crime investigation TV show. I would sit, my father would make us popcorn, and time flew. Although not very socially skilled, the csi hacker has a charm of its own, right? I may have never been ambitious enough to take a course on digital skills and expect to become the next digital Jesus, Matrix-style, but I cannot say I'm not guilty of picturing myself at least as the csi nerd everytime I open a dark-screened Athom in my computer.

The prospect of learning to work with Python feeds such feelings. But *actually* learning it is more like a humility exercise. Besides the constant realization that I have nothing to say in class (exactly because we wordlessly are forced to admit we know nothing), a mistaken and exaggerated critical sense I'm not able to turn off reminds me that I also have no idea what I'm going to use all of that for. At the same time, deep inside, I know that is the best it could be: I think no thoughtful Professor would choose to increase the burden of their own and of the students with endless explanations. And in this affirmation I find solace.
:)

In order to ground and materialize these essential things for this specific part of the process, I present here my answers to the homework questions.

**Question 1 answer**: The function did not work properly because it separated the 's from the word it was connected, undoing the purpose of contraction (i.e.: make two words one). That happened because there was a command in the algorithm staying that every term on the list must be a letter, so that any non-alphabetical character will be read as a separation of words. This was stated in the function by the code "\W+".

**Question 2** Well, it didn't print correctly. At first, I just went straight to the part of the questions in the notebook, without running all the previous functions above. Following the instructions below the cell, I went back and ran all the functions until the Beyoncé verse worked as in class (this one wasn't working either). Even so, running the cell right above question 2 did not work well: I got a "SyntaxError". The Professor saw that coming and helpfully provided a reason for the problem: I hadn't deleted anything. But I was afraid to, since I didn't know which string we were talking about or how should I split it. My quest finishes here for today. :/

[ pause for breathing, the break of a new day ]

I learned some important things:
1. The hashtag tells python to skip some information, so we use to include human language in the code;
2. I didn't need to go over the whole document and run all the cells; I just needed to run the ones on the same section I'm working at to run it correctly.
3. I was erasing the wrong content; I should have erased only the second line marked by a hashtag;
4. *THE ACTUAL ANSWER FOR THE QUESTION*: Now I was able to run the function correctly because the only thing I did was erase the second hashtaged line and write "I just want to finish before I forget it". The algorithm had been programmed to display a list of the words that made up the sentence I wrote, and, since there was no graphic accent or punctuation (any non-alphabetical character), it ran the list of words perfectly.

**Question 3**: After running the cell, it generated a spreadsheet that organized the contents of the folder called "eebo-test", displaying in different columns the filename, the author, the title, the date (year of publication) and the numer of times the word "virtu" or "vertu" appeared in each document.

**Question 4**: According to google, the character ""ˆ"" in a regular expression, marks the beginning of something. However, I still couldn't figure out what this reg is doing here.
