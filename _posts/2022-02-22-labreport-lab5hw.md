The prospect of learning to work with Python feeds such feelings. But *actually* learning it is more like a humility exercise. Besides the constant realization that I have nothing to say in class (exactly because we wordlessly are forced to admit we know nothing), a mistaken and exaggerated critical sense I'm not able to turn off reminds me that I also have no idea what I'm going to use all of that for. At the same time, deep inside, I know that is the best it could be: I think no thoughtful Professor would choose to increase the burden of their own and of the students with endless explanations.
