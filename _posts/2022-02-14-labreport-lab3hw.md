##Making learning memorable

While hearing instructions for this task, I was following everything pretty much ok. Now that I am supposed to work with RegEx101 *substitution* feature, I feel like going back to scratch, although I can also sense that probably it is just a very small piece of logical thinking that I am missing.

I understood the process of creating a regular expression, with the e-mails example. But I feel like I don't know enough about the substitution, I have not seen enough of somebody working with it to be able to reproduce it.

So I think what I'm messing up is that I am trying to come up with a regular expression that describes what I want to be there, instead of creating a pattern for substitution. So after I copied and pasted the text we were supposed to "fix", I came up with the regular expression as follows, to describe the pattern I wanted it to follow: [A-Za-z],[A-Za-z], [A-Z] - but even here, there was a problem: how can I create a regular expression to define a limit number of characters?

Well, this is certainly going to be a memorable learning experience: after so many unsuccessful attempts, I'm pretty sure I won't forget the solution so soon - as long as I get to it.
