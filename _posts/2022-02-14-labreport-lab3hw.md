**A memorable learning experience**

While hearing instructions for this task, I was following everything pretty much ok. Now that I am supposed to work with RegEx101 *substitution* feature, I feel like going back to scratch, although I can also sense that probably it is just a very small piece of logical thinking that I am missing.

I understood the process of creating a regular expression, with the e-mails example. But I feel like I don't know enough about the substitution, I have not seen enough of somebody working with it to be able to reproduce it.

So I think what I'm messing up is that I am trying to come up with a regular expression that describes what I want to be there, instead of creating a pattern for substitution. So after I copied and pasted the text we were supposed to "fix", I came up with the regular expression as follows, to describe the pattern I wanted it to follow: [A-Za-z],[A-Za-z], [A-Z] - but even here, there was a problem: how can I create a regular expression to define a limit number of characters?

Well, this is certainly going to be a memorable learning experience: after so many unsuccessful attempts, I'm pretty sure I won't forget the solution so soon - as long as I get to it.

## Readings vs Lab

Before actually rolling sleeves to start cleaning data, in class, we engaged in a discussion over an article that advocated the exact opposite: "Against cleaning", by Rawson & Mu√±oz brought up some of the ethical implications of "cleaning data". If we are supposed to deal with data and make it clean enough to be practical and useful for our research purposes, it makes sense to ask what our purposes are. Inevitably, cleaning means not only to make data more presentable, but also to do so while envisioning a certain objective we have in mind.

Turns out that, sometimes, cleaning data might be not as harmless as we think it is. Besides the objectives in the back, we must also remember that cleaning also involves applying normative features, the ones that will determine whether this or that feature makes the databases we're dealing with either "tidy" or "messy", which could be a problem in terms of silencing and erasing diversity. All of these implications will ultimately lead us to discussing *authority*: who are the intellectual communities that establish how our databases should be and what is the impact of that? Certainly, having this in mind will make us take more ethically-oriented choices while dealing with data within the humanities, expanding our skills beyond simply being able to perform tasks digitally.
