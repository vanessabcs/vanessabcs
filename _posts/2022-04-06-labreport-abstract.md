## Abstract for final project: Skepticism to magic and witchcraft in print from the 16th to the 17th century

The creation of platforms such as EEBO (Early English Books Online) and ESTC (English Short Title Catalogue) has yielded fruitful subsequent research on Early Modern publications since it provides structured access to an impressive number of publications beyond museums’ and libraries’ walls. However, even huge databases like these might seem limited when we try to answer specific research questions about specific themes of Early Modern prints such as witchcraft. In addition, although there are significant scholarship and data collection about the people accused of witchcraft, there seems to exist still little research to gather the circulating discourses which foreshadowed and supported the trials, accusations, and executions of so-called “witches”. Thus, this paper presents the creation of a database on such discourses in print in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, that is, the time frame when witch persecution reached its highest stakes. More specifically, we analyze current skeptical arguments on witchcraft, oriented by the questions: What was being published against the witch-hunt at the time of its very peak? Who engaged in such publications, writing, printing, and funding them? To whom did these texts refer, and to whom were they addressed? Were there any thematic or rhetorical trends in particular cities, counties, or countries? Were the arguments against witchcraft the major topic of the examined books, pamphlets, and treatises, or just a section or part of the general work? The fields that compose the database reflect these concerns, but might also raise other insights and new inquiries.

*That, of course is the idea of the project. Although it is far to be completed, and it takes some hours to fill in the values (because I have to collect information from lots of different sources and databases, in English, Latin, German, and French), I have to say it is a super exciting process to do. I feel like I want to stop everything else I'm doing and just keep filling each little gap. It's not only about the completion of the dataset itself; it's the collection process that turns me on. Not to mention the insights it's giving me! Anyway, I now modestly share with you the dataset as it is currently: [CLICK HERE AT OWN RISK; THIS IS AN UNFINISHED WORK!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ow_JvsTxkmBzErvFoufuzd2vUN0uG8t93seGaaSjBLM/edit?usp=sharing)*

That's all for today!
