## Abstract for final project: Skepticism to magic and witchcraft in print from the 16th to the 17th century

The creation of platforms such as EEBO (Early English Books Online) and ESTC (English Short Title Catalogue) has yielded fruitful subsequent research on Early Modern publications, since it provides structured access to an impressive number of publications beyond museums’ and libraries’ walls. However, even huge databases such as these might seem limited when we try to answer specific research questions about specific themes of Early Modern prints such as witchcraft. In addition, although there is significant scholarship and data collections about the people accused of witchcraft, there still seems to exist still little research to gather the circulating discourses which foreshadowed and supported the trials, accusations, and executions of so-called “witches”. Thus, this paper presents the creation of a database on such discourses in print in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, that is, the time frame when witch persecution reached its highest stakes.


###Metadata fields and description

* *Short title:* a shortened version of the full title of the book, to avoid referring to very long titles as the ones that were common in Early Modern print.
* *Full title:* Full title of the book, as it appears in the print’s front cover.
Year of first edition: the year of publication of the first edition of the book. In the case of books translated into English, we will keep here the year of the book’s first publication in its original language.
* *Number of editions:* an account of the number of times the book was reprinted and translated.
* *Fiction or nonfiction:* This section intends to provide answers for the question: was the book promoted, or intended to be read as a work of fictional literature or a work of reference? This section might be changed to “genre”.
* *Printed by:* who owned the printing press that issued the book’s first edition.
* *Author:* The one who claims to have written the book.
* *Dedicated to:* the people that appear in paratextual references, dedications and introductory letters.
* *Language:* language the book was firstly published in.
* *Chapter or book:* this section intends to answer the question: is witchcraft and skepticism to it the topic of the whole book or just a section of it?
* *Source:* where I learned about the existence of the book. Should I add something to register every specific source for data collection?
* *Publishing site:* city where the book was first published.
* *Author’s religious affiliation:* the religious affiliation the author claims to have in the book or, the religious group the author might be attributed in biographical sources (such as the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography), or yet the religious affiliation that can be traced from the evidence provided in the text.
* *Online manuscript:* link for the manuscript version of the first edition (or other editions available) online.

###Audience for dataset

The dataset is primarily aimed at Early Modern Historians and English Literature researchers who focus on popular politics, discourses of witchcraft, skepticism to magic in the 16th and 17th centuries.

###Questions for the dataset

We analyze current skeptical arguments on witchcraft, oriented by the questions:

* What was being published against the witch-hunt at the time of its very peak?
* Who engaged in such publications, writing, printing, and funding them?
* To whom did these texts refer, and to whom were they addressed?
* Were there any thematic or rhetorical trends in particular cities, counties, or countries?
* Were the arguments against witchcraft the major topic of books, pamphlets, and treatises, or did they account for just a section or part of the general work?

The fields that compose the database reflect these concerns, but might also raise other insights and new inquiries.

This last one is the main inspiration for this project, because it is a collection of texts on witchcraft written by German authors. My intention is to focus specifically on _skeptical_ texts on magic and witchcraft published in Europe (therefore, in many different languages). Besides, witchcraft has been often perceived as an unfit topic for academic investigation. On top of that, skeptical texts are not often the first to be mentioned and consulted when research actually happens on the topic, given that primary sources would be assumed to be texts that used to defend their point. This is why it is so important not only to know witch-hunt opponents arguments, but also how and why they did so, potentially unearthing other facts in political Early Modern discourses surrounding witchcraft.

*That, of course, is the _idea_ of the project. Although it is far to be completed, and it takes some hours to fill in the values (because I have to collect information from lots of different sources and databases, in English, Latin, German, and French), I have to say it is a super exciting process to do. I feel like I want to stop everything else I'm doing and just keep filling each little gap. It's not only about the completion of the dataset itself; it's the collection process that turns me on. Not to mention the insights it's giving me! Anyway, I now modestly share with you the dataset as it is currently: [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ow_JvsTxkmBzErvFoufuzd2vUN0uG8t93seGaaSjBLM/edit?usp=sharing)*

That's all for today!
