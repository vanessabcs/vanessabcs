**Why should a humanist code?**

Numbers, computers, programming and making up websites is rarely related to the work of a humanist. Even the field of Digital Humanities is an innovation for Global North and South (the latter even more markedly, I dare say). As Wilson wisely pointed out, "literary scholars have understood numbers as falling outside their domain", politely pointing out to the feeling of exclusion and incapacity before technology Humanities scientists nor rarely feel. This is one strong reason why we should sit facing the computer and get ready to understand what exactly is involved in writing in digital languages and what we might be able to do with/by/through them. This is a change.

**Why was it quite hard for _me_?**

Besides my own insecurities regarding the topic, I struggled for a while with understanding how to work with GitHub Desktop and Atom; first, understanding how to operate these apps, second how to connect one another. I also had some difficulty to find the assignments, because, for me, they looked mingled with the course's posts, so I had to scroll down all the posts until I found what I was looking for. Fortunately, I also had the help of my beautiful colleagues, who promptly and kindly responded my 101-level questions, so after a couple minutes I figured it out and the existence of this post is the incontestable evidence that it worked out fine.

**Why is it worth the effort for _me_?**

Even though I still feel like I do not have the necessary to excel at the tasks required for the course, there's a major purpose to my participation in it. In the beginning, I expected to finish it having learned how to find and work well with digital resources available for my Medieval and Early Modern studies. I still desire to achieve it, though what makes me really motivated to keep it going is the possibility of learning enough so that I can engage at least minimally with Brazilian academia, where such digital resources are unfortunately so limited. I want to learn from this course enough to raise the topic in academic conversations with Brazilian students who might need just a spark to shine in this area, once they have the chance to learn that it exists and what it makes possible for academics with limited financial resources. Finally, I would like to use skills acquired in this course to resonate research on witchcraft, a topic that already faces the effects of taboo, on top of the usual difficulties of dealing with Medieval and Early Modern studies.
