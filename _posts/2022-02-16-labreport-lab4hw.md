** Question 3: What is this document? And, more importantly, what have you learned about the term “mcas” in our corpus overall, and/or the utility or value of “significance” metrics like TF-IDF? Write down short answers to these questions in your notes document. **

bla bla bla

**Question 4: Looking through this list of terms and their “Comparison” values, what observations can you make about terms that are more likely to occur in the humanities corpus vs. terms that are more likely to occur in the science corpus? How are these terms different? Write down short answers to these questions in your notes document.**

**Question 5: What tool(s) did you explore? What did this tool(s) help you to observe about this data and/or what did you learn about this data using this tool(s)? Alternatively, what did you hope to learn about this data using this tool and how (or why) did reality seem to fall short of that expectation? Write down short answers to these questions in your notes document.**
