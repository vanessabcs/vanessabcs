## The Voyant Exercise

**Question 1: How does this change the word cloud, and what are these changes telling you? Write down a short answer in your notes document.**

Taking off the filter for stopwords makes the word cloud completely different. That happens because such stopwords start to take over basically all word occurrences, since they are usually the most common words in English language, being also the most frequent words in *any* text. Therefore, looking at a word cloud like this wouldn't give us much distinctive information, unless the focus of our research are exactly words like prepositions, articles and other terms considered "non-content".

**Question 2: Why is relative frequency sometimes a more useful or accurate measure of a term’s importance than raw frequency? Write down a short answer in your notes document.**

For me, the relative frequency can be more useful sometimes because it indicates the frequency of a term per million, in one document, instead of all the documents available in the database.

**Question 3: What is this document? And, more importantly, what have you learned about the term “mcas” in our corpus overall, and/or the utility or value of “significance” metrics like TF-IDF?**

The present document is an obituary and mcas is a title abbreviation many people in the document share. Therefore, there's not much useful information contained in this word here, so it could be discarded the same way a stopword would be.

**Question 4: Looking through this list of terms and their “Comparison” values, what observations can you make about terms that are more likely to occur in the humanities corpus vs. terms that are more likely to occur in the science corpus? How are these terms different? Write down short answers to these questions in your notes document.**

ANSWER
**Question 5: What tool(s) did you explore? What did this tool(s) help you to observe about this data and/or what did you learn about this data using this tool(s)? Alternatively, what did you hope to learn about this data using this tool and how (or why) did reality seem to fall short of that expectation? Write down short answers to these questions in your notes document.**
