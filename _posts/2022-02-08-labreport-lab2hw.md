**A reading exercise**

Woking with databases described in spreadsheets is, first of all, a reading exercise, especially at the level of decoding. For example, [Post-45 Hathiâ€™s website](https://view.data.post45.org/index) provides a short though clarifying description for each metadata field, so that we can come up with pivot tables to separate specific sets of data that might be transformed (or simply, read) as relevant information for different purposes. Here I played with three metadata fields to offer an example of what information can be read from them: the authors, the geographies, and the subjects.

As illustrated in the picture above, by making up a pivot table out of the names of the authors, we can clearly see the ones most widely represented (by the number of available titles, copies or editions) in the repository. In this case, we can not only read that Trollope, Dickens and James make up the top three popular authors in the archive, but also that no women reached similar representation since Jane Austen is the only woman in the top ten authors in the library.


**Pivot table 2**

In the next pivot table, it is possible to understand that mostly accounted places the works come and speak from are either the USA or European countries. However, there's a problem to be solved: how come it separates equally countries and states? For example, we see that New York is equally compared to other countries. Even so, it is still possible to interpret that the top geographical regions represented in the archives are exact representatives of the global North.
