**A reading exercise**

Woking with databases described in spreadsheets is, first of all, a reading exercise, especially at the level of decoding. For example, [Post-45 Hathiâ€™s website](https://view.data.post45.org/index) provides a short though clarifying description for each metadata field, so that we can come up with pivot tables to separate specific sets of data that might be transformed (or simply, read) as relevant information for different purposes. Here I played with three metadata fields to offer an example of what information can be read from them: the authors, the geographies, and the subjects.


**Pivot Table 1: Authors**


As illustrated in the picture above, by making up a pivot table out of the names of the authors, we can clearly see the ones most widely represented (by the number of available titles, copies or editions) in the repository. In this case, we can not only read that Trollope, Dickens and James make up the top three popular authors in the archive, but also that no women reached similar representation since Jane Austen is the only woman in the top ten authors in the library.


**Pivot table 2**

In the next pivot table, it is possible to understand that mostly accounted places the works come and speak from are either the USA or European countries. However, there's a problem to be solved: how come it separates equally countries and states? For example, we see that New York is equally compared to other countries. Even so, it is still possible to interpret that the top geographical regions represented in the archives are exact representatives of the global North.


**Pivot table 3**

The final pivot table, the one generated on the metadata field of subjects, allows one to see which topics readers of that particular archive are going to have more access to. However, at the same time we can conclude that the collection is strongly focused on works dealing with WWII, we don't have further information about whether the war is the main theme or one of the themes in the accounted books. At the same time, "lesbians" seems to be on the top ten subjects represented in the archive, but we cannot have a clear picture of what is understood as a book about lesbians or simply mentions them.

**Late updates:** I really wanted to add some pictures to illustrate the pivot tables, but I failed. I read in online forums that HTML language would work fine within a md sheet, but maybe it doesn't. Maybe I wrote the incorrect path for the image file. I'm sure by next week I'll be able to insert images and make this a little bit more fun, though.

## Readings vs. Lab

As we worked making data visible with spreadsheets and graphics generated from them, the text "What gets counted counts", by Ignazio & Klein, helped us to understand the role of representation. spreadsheets might help us to visualize data, but what if we have values that do not fit the categories proposed? What happens if we think beyond binary categories (of gender and race, for example) and also beyond hierarchies? Can we come up with enough categories in order to make our "counting" more inclusive?

From my own experience, I know what it feels like not to fit. In Brazil, I was easily read as "white", although I would never identify myself so. Therefore, every time I needed to fill out a form asking about my ethnicity, I marked "pardo", although I never felt comfortable with that as well. "Pardo" is a term used to refer frequently to people with light skin, but who are not of European descent. For census purposes, "pardos" would always be counted alongside black Brazilians, accounting for more than half of our population. But are we really the same, when we are so differently treated, when I know that the color of my skin would hardly be the cause for any mistreatment or blunt racism as black people in Brazil go through every day?

Here in the US, the experience repeats in a different way. To fill out my ethnic information, I am often qualified as "hispanic/latino", even if I don't fit in the hispanic community, but I feel like I am much farther from being white, for obvious reasons. So how can I be "counted"?

Maybe for the sake of inclusion, our graphs might need to be a little bit "messier" in order to more accurately represent reality. One great example was provided by Ignazio & Klein, when they exhibited the picture "Beyond XX and XY", showing clearly that gender, is, in fact, way more diverse than we might have at first learned at school. The whole appearance of the illustration might seem messier than one should expect, which is then accurately closer to reality.

This discussion, however, might lead to a paradox: if we can only exist when we're counted, what happens once we're counted? Do we become just a number, ergo, non-existant? This was certainly the most powerful question that remains open after class.
